"Here I describe what I find to be the most convenient way to get up and "
"running with Idris2. We are going to install the [pack](https://github.com/"
"stefan-hoeck/idris2-pack) package manager, which will install a recent "
"version of the Idris compiler along the way.  However, this means that you "
"need access to a Unix-like operating system such as Linux or macOS. Windows "
"users can make use of [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/"
"about) to get access to a Linux environment on their system. As a "
"prerequisite, it is assumed that readers know how to start a terminal "
"session on their system, and how to run commands from the terminal's command-"
"line. In addition, readers need to know how to add directories to the "
"[`$PATH` variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable))  on their "
"system."
