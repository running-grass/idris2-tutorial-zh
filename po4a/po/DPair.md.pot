"So far in our examples of dependently typed programming, type indices such "

"from values known at compile time. In real applications, however, such "
"information is often not available until runtime, where values depend on the "
"decisions made by users or the state of the surrounding world.  For "
"instance, if we store a file's content as a vector of lines of text, the "
"length of this vector is in general unknown until the file has been loaded "
"into memory.  As a consequence, the types of values we work with depend on "
"other values only known at runtime, and we can often only figure out these "
"types by pattern matching on the values they depend on.  To express these "
"dependencies, we need so called [*sigma types*](https://en.wikipedia.org/"
