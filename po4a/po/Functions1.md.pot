"The most special of the above is the last one. It has a priority of 0, so "
"all other operators bind more tightly.  In addition, function application "
"binds more tightly, so this can be used to reduce the number of parentheses "
"required. For instance, instead of writing `isTriple 3 4 (2 + 3 * 1)` we can "
"write `isTriple 3 4 $ 2 + 3 * 1`, which is exactly the same. Sometimes, this "
"helps readability, sometimes, it doesn't. The important thing to remember is "
